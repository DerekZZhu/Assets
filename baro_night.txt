(Verse 1)
There's a crawler in my bed,
Still got water in my head,
Busted pipes all through the room,
Sea monsters lurking in the gloom.

I smell like a flooded hull,
The Engi's passed out, looking dull,
Submarine's on the ocean floor,
Are those barnacles or something more?

(Pre-Chorus)
Screenshots from last dive,
Struggling to stay alive,
We're screwed,
Oh well,
It's a hull breach blur,
But I'm pretty sure we're screwed,
Damn!

(Chorus)
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, we crashed into the rocks,
Engines failing, taking shots,
Think we patched but still in shock,
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, we drained our fuel supply,
Grab a suit or you will die,
Hull breaches, wanna cry,
Barotrauma night,
We were drowning in the dark,
Lost control, missed the mark,
Now we're sinking, all a lark,
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, I think we broke the sub,
Always say we'll take the dub,
Whoa-oh-oh!

(Verse 2)
Barotrauma night,
Do it all again,
Barotrauma night,
Start the round again,
Trying to fix the hull breach,
Don't know what to tell the captain's speech,
Think the reactor's gonna blow,
Coilguns scattered, nowhere left to go.

(Pre-Chorus)
Mayday calls and SOS,
Think I need a life vest,
That was such a tragic mess,
Blunt force trauma, got no meds
Screenshots from last dive,
Struggling to stay alive,
We're screwed,
Oh well,
It's a hull breach blur,
But I'm pretty sure it ruled,
Damn!

(Chorus)
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, we crashed into the rocks,
Engines failing, taking shots,
Think we patched but still in shock,
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, we drained our fuel supply,
Got no meds we're gonna die,
This line is here just to rhyme,
Barotrauma night,
We were drowning in the dark,
Lost control, missed the mark,
Now we're sinking, all a lark,
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, I think we broke the sub,
Always say we'll take the dub,
Whoa-oh-oh!

(Bridge)
This Friday night,
Restart the round again,
This Friday night,
Do it all again,
This Friday night,
S.O.S., S.O.S., S.O.S., S.O.S.,
S.O.S., S.O.S., S.O.S., S.O.S.

(Chorus)
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, we crashed into the rocks,
Engines failing, taking shots,
Think we patched but still in shock,
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, we drained our fuel supply,
Raid a station, get husk and die
Artie Doolittle was just some guy,
Barotrauma night,
We were drowning in the dark,
Lost control, missed the mark,
Now we're floating, all a lark,
Barotrauma night,
Yeah, I think we broke the sub,
Always say we'll get the dub,
Whoa-oh-oh!

(Outro)
This Baro night,
Restart the round again
